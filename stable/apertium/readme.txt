OntoLex-lemon conversion of *all* Apertium languages from https://github.com/apertium/apertium-trunk

Data structure and URI schema follows the earlier conversion used at TIAD-2019 (http://tiad2019.unizar.es/, see there for details).

We deviate in the following aspects:
- Conversion from native data rather than via historical LMF editions.
- Conversion of all language pairs instead of only Romance + English + Basque
- Monnet-lemon updated to OntoLex-lemon.
- Indirect mapping to lexinfo (not yet: to be provided as separate owl:sameAs statements).
- Use BCP47 language codes for identifying languages (rather than original/ISO-693-3 language codes).

howto (rebuild/refresh)
-----------------------
- Make sure you have internet access, java, svn, wget, and a Un*x shell (tested under Cygwin)
- Make sure you have Apache Jena's arq (or another SPARQL engine) installed, set its path in ./build.sh
- Make sure you have Saxon (or another XSLT 2.0+ processor) installed, set its path in ./build.sh
- Run ./build.sh on a Un*x shell.
- For every language pair, this produces a TSV file conformant with TIAD-2019 specs, and a zip file with the underlying TTL data.
- The script also creates apertium.ttl which holds all morphosyntactic features and their labels (merged from all files).
- The script compiles AUTHORS from the individual source directories.

todos & known issues
--------------------
- No proper metadata, yet.
- Later re-builds should check Apertium COPYING files and update the corresponding files here.
- We do not provide a mapping to lexinfo categories, yet. This should be provided by an external file comprising owl:sameAs statements.
- arq 3.9.0 didn't load the generated Apertium-eu-es_LexiconEU.ttl. However, this is not a TTL error: The TSV file included was generated from TTL using BlazeGraph (Build Version=1.5.3) and curl:
	$> curl -X POST http://localhost:9999/bigdata/sparql --data-urlencode 'query=# return TSV file as used for TIAD-2019

The initial conversion of Apertium XML to RDF (2019) was supported by project "Linked Open Dictionaries" (LiODi), an independent research group funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Science (BMBF, 2015-2020).
Subsequent maintenance and linking with lexinfo was conducted within the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Action "Pret-a-LLOD" (ERC, 2019-2021).
