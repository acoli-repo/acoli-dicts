    * Attempt to fix Debian #759952: FTBFS: hun-eng.tei:69: parser error : Premature end of data in tag body line 67
      Debian sbuild runs a parallel make, which seems to cause the "fails to build". hun-eng.tei.header is 71 lines 
      long, similar to the parser error in line 69. Previously, the Makefile target for hun-eng.tei created the 
      destination file in several steps, using the target name from the beginning. Now two temporary files are 
      created and hun-eng.tei is used only for the final step. Hopefully this will sbuild/parallel make use 
      hun-eng.tei for building hun-eng.c5 only after hun-eng.tei is ready.
