This is the Latin-German dictionary, written by Sebastian Humenda. Please see
the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

The dictionary is transformed from a file called words.xml. This is a condensed
format custom-tailored to the lat-deu dictionary. It is far more efficient than
normal TEI and it's included in the dictibution to inspire future authors.
NOTE: if you plan to edit the TEI source directory, you *have to* exclude the
transformation from words.xml â†’ lat-deu.tei out of the Makefile, otherwise your
work will be lost.
