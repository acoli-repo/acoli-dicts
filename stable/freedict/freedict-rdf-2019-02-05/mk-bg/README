This dictionary is based on the bilingual lexicon from the apertium-mk-bg
package. The conversion to TEI was done as part of Google Code-In.

There are some problems with the conversion - notably, <gramPos> is in the
wrong place, and is not generated; and only basic Part of Speech was
exported - but (hopefully) at some stage in the not-too-distant future there
will be a more robust export system.
