	Some words added, corrections and mark up improvments: sense/cit(without attribute)
	and cit@subtype for literal translation. All the regular plurals have been marked
	up, some irregular plurals may still be in lbl tag. Next steps will be to merge
	entries with the same headword (number of character is one of the freelang file
	limits) and to remove redundant infos (ie there are two entries for a-dreuz: a-dreuz
	and dreuz (a-)).
