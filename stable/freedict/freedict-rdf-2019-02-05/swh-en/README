--------------------------------------------------------------

functional .dict database. For details refer to the dictionary header or
the ChangeLog file.

Version 0.4.1 by Piotr Ba�ski and Beata W�jtowicz (28-mar-2009) is 
a maintenance release, with minor additions and fixes (see the header). 
It contains 2657 entries, 2674 headwords, 5303 tokens in definitions.
It is also accompanied by a (rather crude) .dict release.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.4 by Piotr Ba�ski and Beata W�jtowicz (15-feb-2009) has 
more explicit XML structure, more entries, more equivalents, more
cross-entry references (e.g. between all singular-plural pairs).
It contains 2612 entries, 2629 headwords, 5027 tokens in definitions.

It has been described in a paper entitled <"A repository of free 
lexical resources for African languages: the project and the method"
by Piotr Ba�ski and Beata W�jtowicz, accepted for the AfLaT-2009 
(Language Technologies for African Languages) workshop, part of 
the 12th meeting of the European Association for Computational 
Linguistics (EACL), see http://www.aflat.org/.

For details refer to the dictionary header.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.3 by Piotr Ba�ski and Beata W�jtowicz (30-dec-2008) is a thorough 
upgrade from version 0.0.2 -- the dictionary got cleaned, extended and 
marked up in TEI P5. Many lexicographic features have been introduced, 
for details refer to the dictionary header.

The dictionary forms a package together with:

* the TEI ODD (One-Document-Doesitall) file freedict_swa-eng.xml, from 
which schemas and documentation can be derived, by feeding the file 
into the Roma utility at http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/

* a CSS file freedict-dictionary.css that makes the raw dictionary look more pleasant

* two schema files, RNG and DTD, derived from the ODD but supplied here
in case access to Roma is not available.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.0.2 by Beata W�jtowicz was based on Swahili-Kiswahili to English 
Translation Program by Morris Fried (www.dict.org/links.html), 
which has been supplemented by entries from an older version
of the Freedict Swahili-English Dictionary
created by Horst Eyermann (http://www.freedict.de) from 
the Swahili-Esperanto and Esperanto-English Ergane dictionaries (http://www.travlang.com).
The conversion of Fried's dictionary to DICT format and merging 
it with Eyermann's Ergane-based dictionary
has been done, with some help of Computer Science colleagues,
by Beata Wojtowicz (wierzchob@wp.pl) in June 2004. 
The part of speech information for version 0.0.2 was taken from the Swahili-Kiswahili 
to English Translation Program and added to the entries from Freedict 
Swahili-English Dictionary.
