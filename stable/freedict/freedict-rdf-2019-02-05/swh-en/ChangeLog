  * conversion to OntoLex-lemon

2010-11-02 Piotr Ba�ski [0.4.4]
  * database name change, from swa (Swahili as a macrolanguage) into swh 
     (Kiswahili of Tanzania, etc.)

2009-12-30 Beata W�jtowicz, Piotr Ba�ski [0.4.3]
	* little fixes in equivalents, corrected plural entries with both 
	  derived and non-derived senses (cf. mifugo); added INSTALL to the
	  source distribution.

2009-04-17 Piotr Ba�ski [0.4.2]
	* technical changes against the extension of Freedict scripts converting 
	  TEI *P5* to c5; the header is converted properly at last, so from now on, 
	  its contents will be pasted into this file:
   * Technical changes vis-a-vis Freedict TEI-to-DICT scripts: 
     looking for the balance between project-specific and Freedict-wide 
     properties

      * Split kwenye in two (preposition + copula) - this is a 
        technical move, to unify the nesting level of <note> elements with 
        @type="cl-agr", but it's also in agreement with our POS strategy 
        for this stage of the present dictionary: one entry per POS, and 
        kwenye appears to have lexicalised from whatever -enye is into an 
        uninflected preposition.

      * Moved class agreement information from the abused <note> 
        elements into <gramGrp>, nested inside the regular <gramGrp>; this 
        is another feature carried over from our Swahili-Polish-Swahili 
        project. Unfortunately, <gramGrp> may not carry the @type 
        argument. I could use a <gram> element for this without nesting 
        gramGrps, but the nested gramGrp is intended as a feature 
        structure that holds all agreement information in a single 
        package.

      * All generated plural entries are now @type="pl" (by 
        script). There are 522 such entries in this version.

      * xr/@type="plural-sense" is gone and replaced with the 
        (abused) note/@type="def". This is to make sure that the content 
        of generated plurals will be treated as single definitions later 
        on.

      * note/@type="num" is augmented by @rend="noindent"; this is 
        project-specific and pertains to the way the DICT databases are 
        created. This is not meant to be filled by hand, a script does 
        that when converting the editable dictionary into the final form.

      * The "tokens in definitions" count rose sharply because of 
        the extra words "Plural of" repeated 522 times (they used to be 
        part of <xr>) and also colons or sense numbers in some of the 
        definitions of plurals. This may suggest a change of the formula 
        for this count (or dropping it altogether). OTOH, ignoring plural 
        entries from this count does not seem fair, given that they are by 
        all means informative. The code is now "sum(for $txt in 
        (/TEI/text/body/entry/sense//def/descendant::text() | 
        /TEI/text/body/entry/sense/note[@type ne 
        'editor']/descendant::text()) return 
        count(tokenize(normalize-space($txt),' ')))" - I have fixed it to 
        catch all text nodes, which the previous counts didn't.

   * The intended simplicity of encoding and incremental building of 
     Freedict dictionaries relies to some extent on bordering on tag 
     abuse. Instead of distinguishing between <usg> and <note> elements, 
     I'd rather use more kinds of notes. Added: 

      * @type="lbl" for notes within (definitional) notes - 
        currently only labelling literal translations,

      * @type="usage" for notes describing the usage of the given 
        headword/sense.

      * @type="dom" for crude characteristics of the domain of 
        usage; includes hypernyms (date-fruit).

      * @type="obj" for typical object (most of these values come 
        straight from the Guidelines).

   * Rule: all <note> elements that precede the given equivalent 
     should be inside its <def> (for ease of transformation into c5 and 
     CSS rendering only).

   * Things that should eventually get beautified/modified (while 
     keeping an eye on the balance between project-"neutral" tools and 
     project-specific demands: 

      * benki <n> (pl: {mabenki}) [sg=pl] - mark the lexical 
        (class) ambiguity of the noun (or wait until class info is 
        provided explicitly)

      * in some contexts, some elements are rendered in c5 with a 
        preceding blank line. This is due to legacy code that doesn't 
        really harm, so I do not intend to fix that for now
