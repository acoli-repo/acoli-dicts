Changelog:

 * 2014-08-10, 0.3.5, Yota Moteuchi:
   <sense> tags were not properly set (after the previous conversion of <def>).

   changed. The file was also fully re-indented with xmllint.

   Converted TEI file into text format

   ontologies, use @ana to refer to it from inside gramGrp.

 * 2010-04-22 0.3.2:
   John Darrington: Extended the dictionary (several commits: added POS 
   fields, genders, + over 300 entries). (+ Piotr: little changes in the 
   header, tiny fixes).

 * 2010-03-05 0.3.1:
   Piotr Bański: Merged the old header in. Converted the dictionary to 
   TEI P5, replaced ndashes (or something of that sort, also within 
   headwords) with plain hyphens. Reorganised the directory (NEWS and 
   README out, stuff from shared/ in).

 * 2010-03-04 0.3:
   John Darrington
   * Lots of new words added, (a few deleted) parts of speech added. 
     Genders added. Some horrible errors corrected. Probably some new 
     errors introduced.
   * Verbs were identified using "verbiste", nouns by using 
     freedict's fra-deu dictionary (definitions starting with upper case 
     were assumed to be nouns).
