The TEI P4 version of this database was created by 
FreeDict tools on the basis of the accompanying 
non-XML source file(s). Next, that TEI P4 version 
was converted to TEI P5 using revision 978 of the 
tools/xsl/freedict_P4toP5.xsl script.

In some cases I checked whether a newer version 
of the database existed but I wasn't lucky. 
Still, any maintenance of this dictionary should 
begin by checking on the existence of an updated version.
