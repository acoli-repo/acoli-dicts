This dictionary is based on the bilingual lexicon from the apertium-es-ast
package. The conversion to TEI was done as part of Google Code-In.

There seems to have been a problem in converting mutliword entries, which
would explain why prepositions have been tagged as noun, verb, etc. We'll
look into it.
