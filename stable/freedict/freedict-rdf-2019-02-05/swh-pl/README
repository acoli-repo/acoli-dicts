Swahili-Polish SSSP/FreeDict Dictionary

Version 0.2.2 (9 Sep 2011) is a maintenance release in the source, but the DICT 
export now contains the grammatical description in the front matter, available
in 00-database-info.

Please note the TSV file with Bible names from Jim O'Regan. It has not been
added to the dictionary as of 9 Sep 2011, though it is now part of the archive.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2.1 by Piotr Bański (31-dec-2009) contains only changes outside 
the body of the dictionary (encoded the front matter, added to the header) 
and is accompanied by the standard Freedict release files. It is the first 
source version released (version 0.2 is to be found in the CVS only)

--------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2 by Beata Wójtowicz (13-dec-2009) introduced some corrections into 
the entries.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1 by Piotr Bański (dec-2009) was converted 
from the postscript original by Open Office Writer (ps->pdf, 
copy&paste into Writer, regex + editing), and post-edited in oXygen.


--------------------------------------------------------------

The original version of this dictionary was published electronically under GFDL by 
Beata Wójtowicz in 2003. Beata solicited private student dictionaries, chose 
the best one, by Anna Pytluk, edited it and set it in LaTeX2e for PS/PDF publication.
