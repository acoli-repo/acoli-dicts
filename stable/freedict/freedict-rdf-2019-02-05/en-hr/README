This database used to be named eng-cro.
----------
the .index file resulting from conversion
with xmltei2xmldict needs some manual editing:

2 entries starting with "0," were deleted.
1 entry with "&D" was deleted.

The "-" chars were deleted from the
00-database-xxx entries.

The first 5 lines of the index thus look like this:

00databaseinfo  CD      R8      
00databaseshort T/      4
00databaseurl   U3      o
00databaseutf8  A       CD
