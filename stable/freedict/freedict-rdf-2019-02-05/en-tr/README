This database is not related to the existing (and presently
small) (FreeDict) tur-eng FreeDict database.

The data was taken from the GPL program gtksozluk2:
 
http://www.linuxprogramlama.com/index.php?sayfa=gtksozluk2.htm
ftp://ftp.deu.edu.tr/pub/infosystem/gtksozluk/gtksozluk-2.2.tgz

Original Turkish files were encoded in ISO 8859-9.

Original Author: Mehmet Ali Vardar <ali@linuxprogramlama.com>

The converter splits Turkish entries at ";" characters to separate
senses. It also separates translation equivalents at ","
characters. But this should not be done, since it may split too
aggressively (at wrong places).

After the eng-tur.tei file was made, `make validation` complains:

> nsgmls:eng-tur.tei:136233:13:E: non SGML character number 149

The offending character was subsituted by a "'".


================================================

The TEI P4 version of this database was created by 
FreeDict tools on the basis of the accompanying 
non-XML source file(s). Next, that TEI P4 version 
was converted to TEI P5 using revision 978 of the 
tools/xsl/freedict_P4toP5.xsl script.

In some cases I checked whether a newer version 
of the database existed but I wasn't lucky. 
Still, any maintenance of this dictionary should 
begin by checking on the existence of an updated version.

PS. Something is wrong with the splitting indeed, so 
I leave the P4 version for comparison and commit the 
freedict_P4toP5.xsl script [revision 1005] so that it 
is easy to dig out of the SVN in case another P4-to-P5 
transformation is necessary (possibly, it may be 
easier to fix at the Perl level). In case that happens,
please bear in mind that the P5 header has been modified 
and needs to be copied over to the new P5 version.
