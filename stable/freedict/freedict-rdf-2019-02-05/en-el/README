English - Modern Greek XDXF/FreeDict Dictionary

Version 0.1 - cleaned up and coverted from XDXF by Piotr Ba≈Ñski (09-nov-2009), as 
the 2nd FreeDict dictionary encoded in the P5 version of the TEI Guidelines. Please 
see the header for more details. 

The dictionary is accompanied by schemas, ODD (TEI P5 driver file) and CSS. 
Later on, these files will be stored elsewhere, because they are to be shared 
by all FreeDict dictionaries.
