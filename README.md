# liodi-dicts
dictionaries provided by the project Linked Open Dictionaries (LiODi)

The project "Linked Open Dictionaries" (LiODi, 2015-2020) is a BMBF-funded research group run by the Applied Computational Linguistics (ACoLi) lab in collaboration with the Institute for Empirical Linguistics at Goethe University Frankfurt. It aims at creating Linked Open Data representations of dictionaries and the development of an infrastructure and methodologies for their practical application in language contact studies, mostly in Eurasia and the Caucasus area. See http://acoli.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/liodi for details. As a technical basis, we employ lemon/ontolex (https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/) for data modelling, OLiA (http://purl.org/olia) for representing grammatical information, lexvo (http://lexvo.org) for ISO 639 language identifiers and glottolog (http://glottolog.org) for identifiers of non-ISO-639 language varieties.
