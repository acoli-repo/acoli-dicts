Conversion of StarDict dictionaries

restricted to "free-to-use" and open source dictionaries

note that the Starling format is extremely shallow by marking up only the head word and the article. 
Furthermore, it seems that indices are occasionally incorrect, and that the headword as listed in the 
index may only be a substring of the actual headword. Neither of these errors have been fixed. 
Therefore, the converter remains experimental.
